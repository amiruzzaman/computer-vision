# 📷 Camera Homework Assignment

**Course:** Computer Vision / Camera  
**Instructor:** Dr. Amir  
**Assignment:** Homework 2  
**Total Points:** 100  

## Overview

This homework is designed to help you understand how **camera-related parameters** affect the output of a computer vision pipeline. You will work with a provided Jupyter notebook, observe its behavior **without any modifications**, and then explore how changing parameters alters the results.

The goal is not only to run code, but to **reason about cause and effect**: *what changed, why it changed, and what you learned from it*.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Correctly run and reproduce results from an existing Jupyter notebook
* Identify key camera or image-processing parameters
* Systematically modify parameters and observe changes in output
* Compare results before and after parameter changes
* Clearly document and explain your observations in a written report

---

## Provided Materials

* **Starter Notebook**: `camera-homework.ipynb`

  * This notebook contains all required code and default parameters
  * It represents the **baseline experiment**

---

## Part 1: Run the Starter Notebook (No Changes)

1. Open `camera-homework.ipynb`.
2. **Run every cell from top to bottom**.
3. ⚠️ **Do NOT change any code or parameters** in this notebook.
4. Ensure that:

   * All cells execute successfully
   * All figures, images, or outputs are visible
5. Save the notebook **with outputs included**.

This notebook serves as your **baseline reference**.

---

## Part 2: Create a Modified Notebook

1. Make a **copy** of the original notebook.
2. Rename it using the following format:

```
camera-homework-modified.ipynb
```

3. In the copied notebook:

   * Change **one or more parameters** (e.g., camera settings, thresholds, kernel sizes, resolution, noise level, etc.)
   * Do **not** remove functionality or rewrite the entire pipeline

4. Clearly document your changes using **Markdown cells**, including:

   * Which parameters you changed
   * Original values vs. new values
   * Why you chose to change them

5. Run the entire modified notebook and **save all outputs**.

---

## Part 3: Compare Results

In your **modified notebook**, you must:

* Show the updated outputs (images, plots, metrics, etc.)
* Make sure results are clearly visible
* Optionally include side-by-side comparisons or captions

Your comparison should focus on **observable differences**, such as:

* Image quality
* Noise levels
* Sharpness or blur
* Detection or segmentation behavior
* Stability or failure cases

---

## Part 4: Written Report

You must submit a short report (PDF or Markdown) addressing the following:

### Required Sections

1. **Introduction**

   * Briefly describe the purpose of the notebook and experiment

2. **Baseline Results**

   * Summarize what happens with the original (unchanged) parameters

3. **Parameter Changes**

   * List each parameter you modified
   * Explain what the parameter controls

4. **Observed Effects**

   * Describe how the output changed after modification
   * Include references to figures or results from your notebook

5. **Discussion**

   * Why do you think these changes occurred?
   * Were the results expected or surprising?

6. **Conclusion**

   * Key takeaways
   * What you learned about camera parameters and system behavior

---

## Submission Checklist

You must submit **all three items**:

* ✅ Original notebook (unchanged, with outputs)
* ✅ Modified notebook (with changed parameters and outputs)
* ✅ Written report (PDF or Markdown)

⚠️ Missing any component may result in point deductions.

## Grading Criteria and Point Distribution (Total: 100 Points)

Grading for this homework is intentionally simple and focuses on **completion, correctness, and reasoning**.

### 1. Original Notebook (Unchanged) — 30 points

* **Runs without any changes (20 pts)**: Notebook executes top-to-bottom successfully
* **Outputs saved and visible (10 pts)**

### 2. Modified Notebook — 40 points

* **Parameter changes made (15 pts)**: One or more meaningful parameters are changed
* **Notebook runs successfully (15 pts)**: All cells execute and show updated outputs
* **Brief documentation (10 pts)**: Markdown notes explaining what was changed and why

### 3. Written Report — 30 points

* **Description of baseline results (10 pts)**
* **Description of modified results (10 pts)**
* **Explanation of differences and observations (10 pts)**

---

## Academic Integrity

* Do **not** copy reports or notebooks from other students
* You may discuss concepts, but all work must be your own

---

## Questions?

If anything is unclear, ask **before** the deadline. Debugging is part of the assignment — silence is not.

Good luck, and be curious! 🚀
